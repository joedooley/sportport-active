## Customer Checkout Flow

To pay using Pay with Amazon, customers need to first sign in with their Amazon account.  They can do this from two places.

### Cart sign-in widget

On the cart page, customers see a ‘Pay with Amazon’ button next to the regular checkout button:

![Cart sign-in widget](images/sign-in-from-cart-page.png)

### Checkout sign-in widget

On the regular checkout page, customers see a banner asking if they want to Pay with Amazon:

![Checkout sign-in widget](images/sign-in-from-checkout-page.png)

### Signing in

Both buttons trigger a sign-in window that opens and looks similar to this:

![Amazon Payments Sign-in window](images/amazon-payments-sign-in.png)

After signing in, the customer is redirected to a special version of the checkout that shows Amazon widgets.

### Amazon Checkout Page

Upon reaching the checkout page, note that the regular billing and shipping forms are missing. This is normal — they have been replaced by Amazon widgets:

![Checkout page](images/checkout-page.png)

Customers choose their desired shipping address and payment method, and this refreshes the WooCommerce order totals as normal.

They then click the ‘Place Order’ button. This create an order in WooCommerce for you to process.

## Admin Order Fulfillment Flow

When an order comes in via Pay with Amazon, it is placed On Hold. If you view/edit the order, a new meta box appears on your Orders screen:

![Amzon meta box](images/amazon-meta-box.png)

This widget allows you to perform the following actions:

* **Authorize** &mdash; Authorize a payment but do not capture yet. Amazon recommends capturing payment once you have verified the order and have begun processing it.
* **Authorize and Capture** &mdash; Capture the full order total amount.
* **Capture** &mdash; Capture an authorized payment. Amazon recommends capturing payment once you have fulfilled the order.
* **Close authorization** &mdash; Close an authorization and release funds without capturing.
* **Refund** &mdash; If you captured a payment that is still open, you can refund X amount.

After each action, an order note is created, noting the status.

To view your Amazon Payments Seller account balance, visit:

* US: https://sellercentral.amazon.com
* EU: https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com
* JP: https://sellercentral-japan.amazon.com

## REST API

Since 1.6.0, Pay with Amazon exposes some functionalities through REST API.

The Pay with Amazon REST API allows you to authorize, capture, and close authorization.
The endpoint is `/wp-json/wc/v1/orders/<order_id>/amazon-payments-advanced/`.

### List of orders paid via Amazon Payments

There's no custom endpoint to retrieve list of orders paid via Amazon Payments. The built-in orders point can be used with
`_payment_method=amazon_payments_advanced` filter.

```
GET /wp-json/wc/v1/orders?filter[_payment_method]=amazon_payments_advanced
```

```
curl -g -X GET 'https://example.com/wp-json/wc/v1/orders?filter[_payment_method]=amazon_payments_advanced' -u consumer_key:consumer_secret
```

For CURL request that involves filter query (`[]`), you need to specify `-g` (to turn off [URL globbing](http://ec.haxx.se/cmdline-globbing.html)).

JSON response example:

```
[
  {
    "id": 132,
    "status": "on-hold",
    "order_key": "wc_order_57bb41b6eeb32",
    "number": 4606,
    "currency": "GBP",
    ...
    "amazon_reference": {
      "amazon_reference_state": "Open",
      "amazon_reference_id": "S02-0312204-2022855",
      "amazon_authorization_state": "",
      "amazon_authorization_id": "",
      "amazon_capture_state": "",
      "amazon_capture_id": "",
      "amazon_refund_ids": []
    },
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

Orders paid via Amazon Payments will have `amazon_reference` on order item.

The `filter` parameter can be used with `status` parameter to retrieve list of orders that have been authorized but not captured yet.

```
curl -g -X GET 'https://example.com/wp-json/wc/v1/orders?filter[_payment_method]=amazon_payments_advanced&filter[amazon_authorization_state]=Open&status=on-hold' -u consumer_key:consumer_secret

## FAQ

### Will this gateway work with X extension that modifies the WooCommerce checkout page?

Generally, no. Pay with Amazon uses its own forms for payment and shipping, so plugins that add or modify WC checkout may not work in these cases. Since 1.6.0, compatibilities with extensions that modify checkout page has been added. Those are extensions are:

* [WooCommerce Drip](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-drip/)
* [WooCommerce Dynamic Pricing](https://woocommerce.com/products/dynamic-pricing/)
* WooCommerce German Market

### Can I use Pay with Amazon/Amazon Payments Advanced with WooCommerce Subscriptions?

Yes, this Amazon integration supports recurring payments with [WooCommerce Subscriptions](https://woocommerce.com/products/woocommerce-subscriptions/?_ga=1.101887745.1089344366.1467581921) (separate purchase). More info at: [Subscription Payment Methods & Gateways](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/payment-gateways/). By default, subscription is disabled when store base location is set to Germany or UK. Notice will displayed in such case:


Merchant needs to [contact Amazon](https://payments.amazon.com/contact) first. A filter `woocommerce_amazon_pa_seller_supports_recurring_payment` available to bypass that:

```
add_filter( 'woocommerce_amazon_pa_seller_supports_recurring_payment', '__return_true' );
```

### Where should I go to view my Amazon account balance?

To view your Amazon Payments Seller account balance, visit http://sellercentral.amazon.com for the US; or https://sellercentral-europe.amazon.com) for Europe; or https://sellercentral-japan.amazon.com/ for Japan. Not payments.amazon.com, payments.amazon.co.uk or payments.amazon.de or payments.amazon.co.jp

### My Amazon payments widgets look stretched or distorted on my mobile device. How do I resolve this?

Stretching or distortion of Amazon payments widgets when viewing your website on a mobile device is largely due to the WordPress theme you’re using. It may add padding around the widgets, causing the irregular display.

To fix, add the following CSS code to “style.css” in your child theme; or the “style.css” file in your parent theme if you’re not yet using a child theme:

```
#amazon_addressbook_widget div, #amazon_wallet_widget div {
    min-width: 260px !important;

}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Shipping costs are missing

This can occur if the following option is enabled. Disabling should solve the issue:

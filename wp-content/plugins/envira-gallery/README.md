Envira Gallery
==============

Envira Gallery is the best responsive WordPress gallery plugin.

## Motivation

My motivation for building this plugin is two-fold. First, I have been wanting to build Soliloquy v2 for a while, and I needed to get away from the rigid Attachment data structure that WordPress provides. It is way too limiting, so I wanted to stay away from it as best as possible. The data structure for this plugin is flexible enough to be used for Envira, and once I discovered that (it wasn't my intention in the first place), I added a new motivation: **to kill off NextGen Gallery.**

I'm being completely serious when I say I want to take NextGen gallery head on. That plugin is a monster that overruns everything where it is installed. It is a resource hog, very clunky with its workflows, and has numerous data issues that wreak havoc on shared hosts. I think the WordPress community can do much, much better, and since WordPress has such a large number of creatives, I wanted to build a plugin that was easy and fast without sacrificing the potential for abundant features.

So yes, in a sense, you are helping take NextGen down. I can't do this on my own - I'll need the help of the entire community to take that monster down, but I think we as a team can do it! :-)

## Beta Testing

**First of all, I want to thank everyone who is willfully beta testing this product.** My intention is to create a gallery plugin with an incredibly simple workflow, a powerful yet flexible data structure and a ridiculously fast I/O. In other words, everything that is not NextGen gallery. ;-)

There will be many addons to accompany this plugin, including NextGen importers amongst other things. They will all be using the internal hooks and filters, so if you would like to test them out, that would rock!

## Submitting an Issue

If you believe you have found a bug or something that needs to be modified/changed, you will want to submit it on the [issues](https://github.com/thomasgriffin/envira-gallery/issues) page. Here are some steps:

1. Make sure you list the exact steps you took to produce the issues if it is a bug. This way I can reproduce the error and know how to fix it.
2. If you are making a feature suggestion, you must explain how it will help simplify or improve the workflow of the plugin.
3. Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any suggestions, but I warn you, there are strict coding standards with this plugin, and they must be followed exactly in order for me to accept your pull request (spaces not tabs, proper WordPress coding standards, documented, DRY).

## Other Considerations

Anything having to do with the Settings page is not complete yet. It will be the last piece to add since I will have to finish the marketing side of the plugin first. It will not affect the plugin at all.

Thanks again for helping me beta test this product. It should be out for the general public in about a week. This product will also be the base of Soliloquy v2, so I appreciate all of your inputs and suggestions.

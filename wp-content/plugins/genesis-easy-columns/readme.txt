== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where are the column buttons? =

The easy insert buttons are located in your WordPress editor.  They will be visible within the text editor when creating or editing a page or post.

Version 1.1 added an option for non-Genesis users to add the optional CSS via Settings > Easy Columns.  You must have the necessary CSS to format the columns.

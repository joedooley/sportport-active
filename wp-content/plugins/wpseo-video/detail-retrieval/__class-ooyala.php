/*
 Service: ooyala
 
 Current status: let's not

 Offers an extensive api, but very little useful methods to actually retrieve information.
 Looks like we might need to make numerous API calls to get little snippets of information each time.
 All API calls need authorisation, so we'd either need to include a key or ask the user for their
 API key via the admin interface.

 - Embedly does *not* offer useful results (or any for that matter)
 - There seems to be a Ooyala WP plugin: https://wordpress.org/plugins/ooyala-video-browser/ (currently unsupported)

    * Makes sure that the video sitemap will be available as soon as this plugin is activated and unavailable after deactivation.
    * Fixes "Disable video for this post" per-post setting not being respected for the og: meta tags which led to Facebook still displaying the video even if the video for the post was disabled.
    * If an invalid date is encountered for the publication date of a video post, the publication date will be re-evaluated.
    * If a video post title or content/excerpt is - or has been - updated, this will now be reflected in the sitemap and the video meta data. (needs force re-index for existing posts)
    * If a video post SEO title or SEO description is - or has been - added/adjusted, this will now be reflected in the sitemap. (needs force re-index for existing posts)
    * If a SEO description template had been set for the post type which includes the video, this will now be respected. (needs force re-index for existing posts)

    * The "Force re-index" functionality was broken with the implementation of the progress bar. This has now been fixed. Checking the "Force re-index" checkbox will now work again as expected, including the regeneration of thumbnails.
    * The "Re-index" functionality did not properly respect the post types to be indexed for the Video sitemap as set on the VideoSEO settings page, which unintentionally led to fewer items being re-indexed than they should. This has now been fixed.
    * The re-index functionality has been made more efficient and should now - for the same number of posts - be faster.
    * The sitemap cache was not automatically cleared after a re-index. This has now been fixed.

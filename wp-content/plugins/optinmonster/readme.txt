= OptinMonster Builder + Optin Forms Templates =

OptinMonster allows you to build high converting opt-in forms in minutes, not hours!

You can choose from 8 different type of optins including: popup forms, floating bars, slide-ins, sidebar forms, after-post forms, in-line forms, mobile-only popup forms, and Canvas.

All of our templates are 100% responsive and mobile friendly.

= Easy Integration with All Email Marketing Services =

We started with the goal to make the most beginner friendly lead generation plugin. That's why OptinMonster works out of the box with all popular email marketing service providers including but not limited to:

MailChimp, AWeber, Infusionsoft, GetResponse, ConstantContact, CampaignMonitor, Hubspot, Marketo, ActiveCampaign, Pardot, TotalSend, Emma, iContact, MailerLite, Customer.io, MailPoet, and FeedBlitz.

You can also use custom HTML forms as well as use shortcodes to add other form plugins such as Gravity Forms, Ninja Forms, etc.

= Powerful Exit-Intent&reg; Technology =

OptinMonster is among the pioneers of <a href="http://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/" rel="friend" title="Exit-Intent Technology">exit-intent technology</a>. It helps you track user's mouse behavior and prompt them with a targeted message at the precise moment they are about to leave.

This allows you to re-engage the visitor and encourage them to subscribe. Exit-intent is proven to increase conversions.

We used it on our site, <a href="http://www.wpbeginner.com/" rel="friend" title="WPBeginner - Beginners Guide to WordPress">WPBeginner</a>, and increased conversions by over 600%.

But don't just take our word. See what one of the experts are saying:

> In only 7 months, <strong>we added more than 95,000 names to our email list</strong> using OptinMonster's Exit Intent™ technology. We strongly recommend it!<br>
> Michael Stelzner - Founder of Social Media Examiner

= Advanced Page Level Targeting and Behavior Personalization =

Have you ever wondered what if you created a highly targeted message based on the specific page, traffic referral source, category or tag of your site? How would that impact your conversions?

Well, we have tested it, and it works wonders. We liked the results so much that we built-it into OptinMonster.

OptinMonster's <a href="http://optinmonster.com/features/page-level-targeting/" rel="friend" title="Page Level Targeting">page level targeting module</a> allows you to display unique offers and campaigns based on visitor's location and interaction on your website.

This allows you to segment your email list and group your subscribers based on their interest and interaction with your website. Segmentation allows you to send relevant emails to your subscribers which results in higher open rates, higher click through rate, increased sales, greater revenue, greater customer retention, and lower unsubscribe rate.

> Matthew Woodward - Professional Blogger and SEO Expert

= Easy to Use A/B Split Testing =

A/B testing is one of the most desired features, but normally it is extremely hard to setup for beginners. Well, we changed that.

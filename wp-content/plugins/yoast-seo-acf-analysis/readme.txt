Adds the content of all ACF fields to the Yoast SEO content analysis.

== Description ==
[Yoast WordPress SEO's](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/) score analysis does not take in to account the content of a post's [Advanced Custom Fields](http://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). This plugin uses Yoast WordPress SEO 3.1's plugin system to hook into the analyser in order to add ACF content to the SEO analysis.

This had previously been done by the [WordPress SEO ACF Content Analysis](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-seo-acf-content-analysis/) plugin but that no longer works with Yoast 3.0. Kudos to [ryuheixys](https://profiles.wordpress.org/ryuheixys/), the author of that plugin, for the original idea.

Please note that the plugin does not work with WYSIWYG fields for ACF yet, we're working on this.

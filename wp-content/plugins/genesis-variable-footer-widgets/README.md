Create multiple footer widget's from a select menu in Genesis Theme Settings. From 0 to 6 widgets in seconds!

== Description ==

GitHub: https://github.com/joe-dooley/genesis-simple-footer-widgets

This plugin allows you to create multiple footer widget's from a select menu within Genesis Theme Settings. 

Creating footer widgets can be a nuisance from project to project. Sometimes the original design calls for 4 footer widgets and by default Genesis only has the proper code for 3 footer widgets.

Genesis Simple Footer Widgets allows you to easily go from no footer widgets to 6 footer widgets without having to worry about adding additional CSS or registering new widget areas.

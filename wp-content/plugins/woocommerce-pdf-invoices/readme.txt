== Frequently Asked Questions ==

#### How to add your custom template?
Copy the default template files (including folder) you'll find in `plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices/includes/templates/invoice/simple` to `uploads/woocommerce-pdf-invoices/templates/invoice/simple`. The plugin will automatically detect the template and makes it available for selection within the Template Settings. Now go ahead and start making some changes to the template files! :)

Important: Before you update the plugin, always have a look at the Changelog if their have been any changes to the template files. There will be updates that require updating your custom template!

#### How to add a fee to the invoice?
To add a fee to WooCommerce and your invoice, simply add the following action to your themes `functions.php`.

`
function add_woocommerce_fee() {
    global $woocommerce;

    if ( is_admin() && ! defined( 'DOING_AJAX' ) )
        return;

    $amount = 5;
    $woocommerce->cart->add_fee( 'FEE_NAME', $amount, true, 'standard' );
}
add_action( 'woocommerce_cart_calculate_fees','add_woocommerce_fee' );
`

#### How to hide order item meta?
To hide order item meta from the invoice, simply add the following filter to your themes `functions.php`.

`
/**
 * Hide order itemmeta on WooCommerce PDF Invoices' invoice template.
 *
 * @param array $hidden_order_itemmeta itemmeta.
 *
 * @return array
 */
function bewpi_alter_hidden_order_itemmeta( $hidden_order_itemmeta ) {
	$hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_wc_cog_item_cost';
	$hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_wc_cog_item_total_cost';
	$hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_subscription_interval';
    $hidden_order_itemmeta[] = '_subscription_length';
	// end so on..
	return $hidden_order_itemmeta;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_hidden_order_itemmeta', 'bewpi_alter_hidden_order_itemmeta', 10, 1 );
`

#### How to change the common PDF options?
To change the more common options of the PDF, use below example.

`
function custom_bewpi_mpdf_options( $options ) {
 	$options['mode'] = '';
 	$options['format'] = ''; // use [format]-L or [format]-P to force orientation (A4-L will be size A4 with landscape orientation)
 	$options['default_font_size'] = 0;
 	$options['default_font'] = 'opensans';
 	$options['margin_left'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_right'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_top'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_bottom'] = 0;
 	$options['margin_header'] = 14;
 	$options['margin_footer'] = 6;
 	$options['orientation'] = 'P'; // Also try to force with format option

 	return $options;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_mpdf_options', 'custom_bewpi_mpdf_options' );
`

#### How to change the more advanced PDF options?
To fully customize the PDF, use below code. This filter gives you full control over the mPDF library. Check the mPDF [manual](https://www.dropbox.com/s/h44f7v5anvcmmvl/mpdfmanual.pdf?dl=0) for more info.

`
function bewpi_mpdf( $mpdf, $document ) {
    // change the direction of the invoice to RTL
    $mpdf->SetDirectionality( 'rtl' );

    return $mpdf;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_mpdf', 'bewpi_mpdf', 10, 2 );
`

#### How to display invoice download button on specific template files?
Add below code for example to your "thankyou" page or "customer-completed-order" email template.

`
$order_id = method_exists( 'WC_Order', 'get_id' ) ? $this->order->get_id() : $this->order->id;
echo do_shortcode( '[bewpi-download-invoice title="Download (PDF) Invoice {formatted_invoice_number}" order_id="' . $order_id . '"]' );
`

For use in WordPress editor use below shortcode. This will only work if you replace "{ORDER_ID}" with an actual order id.

`
[bewpi-download-invoice title="Download (PDF) Invoice {formatted_invoice_number}" order_id="{ORDER_ID}"]
`

Note: Download button will only be displayed when PDF exists and order has been paid.

#### How to skip invoice generation based on specific payment methods?
Add the name of the payment method to the array.

`
function bewpi_attach_invoice_excluded_payment_methods( $payment_methods ) {
    return array( 'bacs', 'cod', 'cheque', 'paypal' );
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_attach_invoice_excluded_payment_methods', 'bewpi_attach_invoice_excluded_payment_methods', 10, 2 );
`

#### How to skip invoice generation in general?
Add below function to your themes 'functions.php' file.

`
function bewpi_skip_invoice_generation( $skip, $status, $order ) {
    // Do your stuff based on the order.

    return true; // True to skip.
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_skip_invoice_generation', 'bewpi_skip_invoice_generation', 10, 3 );
`

#### How to allow specific roles to download invoice?
Add the name of the role to the array. By default shop managers and administrators are allowed to download invoices.

`
function bewpi_allowed_roles_to_download_invoice($allowed_roles) {
    // available roles: shop_manager, customer, contributor, author, editor, administrator
    $allowed_roles[] = "editor";
    // end so on..
    return $allowed_roles;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_allowed_roles_to_download_invoice', 'bewpi_allowed_roles_to_download_invoice', 10, 2 );
`

### How to alter formatted invoice number? ###
Add following filter function to your 'functions.php' within your theme.

`
function alter_formatted_invoice_number( $formatted_invoice_number, $document_type ) {
   if ( $document_type === 'invoice/global' ) { // 'simple' or 'global'.
      // add M for global invoices.
      return 'M' . $formatted_invoice_number;
   }

   return $formatted_invoice_number;
}
add_filter( 'bewpi_formatted_invoice_number', 'alter_formatted_invoice_number', 10, 2 );
`

### How to add custom fields/meta-data to the PDF invoice template? ###
Use below code to display meta-data. Replace `{META_KEY}` with the actual key. If you use another plugin, just ask the key from the author of that plugin.

`
<?php echo BEWPI()->templater()->get_meta( '{META_KEY}' ); ?>
`

Important: A custom template is required to add a custom field to the PDF invoice.
